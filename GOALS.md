## Why a Content Team?

We have a large collection of resources available to the community. Also numerous channels of communications. These needs require a team that can aggregate, organise and distribute.

Also we need to provide an assistance to the community to generate this content by providing feedback.

Finally we should coordinate efforts with other groups promoting Rust e.g. Mozilla Hacks, This Week in Rust, Read Rust.

## What Forms of Content are Relevant for the Content Team?

Videos, podcasts and blog posts.

## Possible actions

- Cross promote channels e.g. Community.rs blogposts highlighting our favourite videos.
- A short video on how to get started with Rust on the RLO front page (can’t remember who suggested this).
- Syndicate Rust content to medium.com and dev.to
- Help out in producing a "Rust planet"
- Help out in producing a "Rust magazine"
- Kanban board listing current campaigns and projects.

## Measurable objectives
