## Checklist for running a Content team meeting

### Before meeting

- Close the last agenda (important because the following shortened URL relies on their only ever being one open issue as the current agenda.
- A day before create a new agenda using the following [link](https://github.com/rust-community/content-team/issues/new?template=meeting_agenda.md)
- Collate any comments (if people do not have access to edit) and add to agenda. Have an approximate time that agenda item will need to be discussed for. Use your discretion to ensure that items will not cause be meeting to over run

### On the day of the meeting

- Announce the start of the meeting
- Time keeping is essential, apologise if we over run.
- Create actions as soon as they are discovered, try to get assignees too.

### After meeting

- Gather minutes by going to irc logs
- Relax and unwind
- Thank you for running the meeting!

## Communication how and when to do it

### Use of hashtags

Hashtags are primarily used in social networks, in particular Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon, etc. There have been occasions where they have been used to identify a campaign in emails or discussion in IRC e.g. #RustReach and #Rust2018. 

For the purpose of providing a tangible example for this guide, we'll use Twitter are our point of reference and it's verb "Tweet" as the way to write an update on the social network.

It is important that such tags are not misappropriated by Rust related items that are not on topic. Just as you would not send a tweet with #RustLang hashtag if it was not Rust related, you should not misuse the following hashtags:

`#RustReach` - This is a specific Rust team programme to grow the community's project collaborators and leaders by reaching to people whose groups and backgrounds are underrepresented in the Rust community and the technology world as a whole. This is not a general drive to extend the "reach" of Rust to the community as a whole.

Whilst we don't have a definitive list, use your judgement and if in doubt ask before sending a tweet with the hashtag.

### Spamming

This is the act where you repeatedly post the information on a daily or more frequent basis.

In short, do not do it.

Where possible it's better to retweet others who saying something similar, or reword the message so there is some variation.
